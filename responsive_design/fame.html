            Through the progression of the documentary, we are revealed the alienation between Amy Winehouse and the outside world. Though fame may be perceived as a life of glamor and wealth, the downsides are much more apparent than the positives, especially for Amy Winehouse being exploited in the music industry, where mental health is often overlooked. Amy Winehouse's unique persona and ability to speak through her music also sparked a revival in the jazz music genre. Yet, disconnected from this rise of success, Amy Winehouse struggled with addiction to drugs, alcohol, and an eating disorder. Traced back to the many difficulties in her life, including the negative influence of those close to her, such as her ex-husband Blake in his contribution to her drug abuse and her father who disregarded her mental health and appeared in her life when he saw her success as convenient to keep earning money. Amy faced scrutiny for her struggles, which was evident through the constant paparazzi presence and lack of privacy. This impacted her later performances, in which she was booed and insulted for not wanting to sing. This included disrespectful jokes and criticism about her appearance. The music industry's impact on young and impressionable artists, such as Amy Winehouse, who was still discovering herself and was forced to prioritize performances over her emotional well-being, was truly unfortunate to see as she was suffering beyond the awards and praise. The media's biased and derogatory representation of Amy Winehouse influenced people's perception of her, and to behave and think about her in a negative way. As stated by Tony Benett "Life teaches you how to live it if you live long enough" touches upon the many talented people who have gone too soon and what it was like to record “Body & Soul” with Amy Winehouse, as a true musical powerhouse yet a highly criticized and targeted person in society.
