            The documentary "Amy," directed by Asif Kapadia, delves into the life of the talented singer Amy Winehouse and her music career. It showcases her evolution as a musician and the impact she had on her fans and the music world. Through personal footage and interviews, we gain a deeper appreciation of Winehouse's immense talent, despite the personal struggles and money-hungry enablers that ultimately led to her death. Kapadia’s documentary on Amy Winehouse’s life and the intimate scenes we see of her battling addiction and fame also focus on her in all her vulnerability. Although this documentary was painful and devastating, her devotion to music was something the media didn’t portray accurately. The documentary also served as a tribute to her career as it's not exploitative but eye-opening to the many other young, talented, and flawed celebrities who have been wronged in the music industry.
